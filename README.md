## NAME: DHANUSHA K

# Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works using ChatGPT. The goal is to observe how different prompt structures affect content quality, coherence, and creativity.

# Procedure:
# 1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns
Before generating content, the following prompt patterns were studied and applied:
Query Decomposition: Breaking a complex query into smaller, manageable parts.
Decision Making: Letting the model choose between alternative directions or options.
Answer Engineering: Structuring the response by giving explicit formatting and content instructions.
Fact Checklist: Ensuring factual correctness and data verification.
Tail Generation: Extending or deepening the narrative logically.
Menu Actions: Providing multiple options for the model to choose the best response.
Semantic Filtering: Controlling tone, accuracy, and style (e.g., formal, creative, technical).

# 2. Choosing the Content Type
Two types of content were selected:
Business Report on Market Trends (Analytical and factual)
Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story (Imaginative and narrative-driven)

# 3. Creating the Prompts and Generating Outputs
